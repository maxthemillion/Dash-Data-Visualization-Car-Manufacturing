# Dashboard for Data Visualization of Quality Data in Car Manufacturing Plants
In production lines mistakes are made by humans or machines that lead to defects on the cars running on the production lines. Information about the defects and the reparation processes in the plants are saved in datasests, which are analyzed by the car manufacturers. Important informations are for example how many defects happend and how long did the rework process last to fix the defect. The shorter the duration of the rework activity the better for the car manufacturers, as rework activity costs money.

The Pythonfile **Showcase.py** generates a Dash Dashboard which shows Information about Quality Data in Car Manufacturing Plants.
